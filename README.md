How many of these account's ads have you seen?

I made this extension so we can easily share our blocked users list.

As you can see in this image most bios contain these texts:
- Here we sell items for daily use in the household, utility items, decorations
- Online store selling items for everyday household needs
- The store sells decorative items, household items for daily use
- We are an online store, selling everyday household items, toys


Feel free to open issues if you find more bios or more accounts, I'll block them myself and add them here.
